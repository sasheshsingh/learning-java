# Day 1: Data Structure
### Overview

Data Structure are efficient way to store & organize the data.The way of storing data can directly helps in easy way of processing, management and retrieval of the data. 

## Types of Data Structure:

Data Structure can be categorized in two ways: **Linear** and **Non-Linear**

### 1. Linear Data Structure: 
These are easy to implement. These are stores in the linearly in the storage.

- **Example:** Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structure:
Data elements are not in sequence. They are basically connected to one another through differenet paths.
Contrary to Linear DS where elements are stored in single level, here data is stored in multi level. 
In order to traverse every element, it is very difficult & can be done in multiple ways.
- ***Example:** Tree & Graph

### Conclusion

Understanding these data structures is foundational for effective programming and algorithm design. 
Each type offers unique advantages and is suited for different types of problems.
